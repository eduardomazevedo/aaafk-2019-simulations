A. Setup Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup

	a. Analysis requires installation of MATLAB R2018a with an access to Python libraries, Python 2.7, Gurobi 7.5. The code was run and tested on a 64-bit linux based machine, kernel 3.10.0.

	b. In order to run any analysis in ./analysis files follow the instructions on the readme.txt in ./aass folder. Running the analysis in parallel requires a linux cluster, but the individual scripts can be run one-by-one on a single computer. We tested the scripts on Univa Grid Engine, and tweaks might be necessary in other cluster setups.


B. Directory Structure and Included Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. The directories are organized as follows:

	i.	./aass (Advanced Asynchronous Simulation System) .sh files used to submit simulation jobs and save data in the cluster.
	ii.	./analysis contains all the exercises.
	iii.	./classes contains main classes file, simulation.m. This includes the core algorithms for kidney matching and for running simulations.
	iv.	./data is a source directory for the all data files.
	v.	./functions have all the functions that are used by ./analysis file
	vi.	./generate-output creates results from simulation data
	vii.	./log saves the log files for analysis
	viii.	./output saves figures, tables and some functions
	ix.	./output-for-manuscript keeps figures, tables and constants for the manuscript
	x.	./py has the relevant python functions.
	xi.	./read-data creates interim outputs that are used by ./generate-output file

b. Obtaining original data files:

 	Researchers interested in using our dataset should directly contact APD, NKR and UNOS to obtain permission:

	APD (Alliance for Paired Donation, Inc.)
	PO Box 965,
	Perrysburg, OH 4352
	Main Number: 419.866.5505

	NKR (National Kidney Registry)
	PO Box 460
	Babylon, NY 11702-0460

	UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)
	700 N 4th St,
	Richmond, VA 23219
	Main Number: 804.782.4800


C. Reproducing the results
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to reproduce the results, one should run all the analyses through AASS system. AASS system takes spec.m files within the analysis folder and runs a set of simulations. Relevant analysis’s results will be saved ./data with in the directory of the analysis. ./read-data has the relevant pieces of code to read the raw data and create interim structs and matrices. ./generate-output has the relevant pieces of code to read the interim outputs from ./read-data and create relevant structs and matrices for the paper.

   a. List of analysis within the ./analysis file as follows:

	i.	./calibration contains an exercise for calibrating some features of the market			13 sets of parameters, 100 rep for each
	ii.	./deadweight-loss contains scripts to calculate deadweight-loss under various settings
	iii.	./different-compositions contains exercises for effects of different compositions		Similar to ./gradient, ./matching-probability and ./scale
	iv.	./gradient contains an exercise for marginal product						1930 patients, 20000 rep for each
	v.	./gradient-cross-derivative contains an exercise to calculate supply elasticies			44 different cross derivative, 1M rep for each
	vi.	./matching-probability contains an exercise for matching probabilities				5M rep
	vii.	./robustness contains exercises for effects of different calibration parameters			Similar to ./gradient, ./matching-probability and ./scale
	viii.	./scale	contains an exercise for size effect							50 different sizes, 300000 rep for each
	ix.	./scale_small contains an exercise for size effect for smaller markets				50 different sizes, 300000 rep for each
	x.	./scale_NKR_double contains an exercise for size effect for larger markets			5 different sizes,  200000 rep for each

   b. To read the data from ./analysis/*/data folders, one should run relevant scripts in the ./output folder under relevant analysis folder. In order to read all the data at once, one should run scripts under the ./read-data folder.

   c. To create relevant files for the manuscript, one should run relevant scripts in the ./output folder under relevant analysis folder. In order to create all the constants and plots at once, one should run scripts under the ./generate-output folder.
